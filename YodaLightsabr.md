# Smart Gift Card

## Summary

Gift cards are nice, but annoying. They can only be spent in one place, and often times you'll forget you have them. This smart gift card will be re-writable and essentially act as the last gift card you'll ever need. It'll use a magnetic stripe reader/writer along with a mobile app to store all of your gift cards in one place. Then, when you want to use one, you just swipe your smart card to set the value, and you can use it. This will work great on the go since you won't have to carry all your gift cards around.

## Plan

The plan is to buy a megnetic stripe reader/writer to handle reading and modifying the card's data. It'll plug into an Arduino UNO (I already have one) that'll control the card reader/writer. Then I'll 3D-print a case for it (I already have a 3d printer).

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
