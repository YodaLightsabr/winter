# Smart Alarm Clock

## Summary

This smart alarm clock will use a Raspberry PI, 7 inch display, and a physical button. Here's what it'll do:

* Display time
* Show weather
* Show calendar events
* Control smart home devices with Homebridge
* Set alarms

## Plan

After getting materials, I plan to wire up the button, raspberry pi, and display to build the clock. Then I'll measure it and 3d print a case so I can put it on my nightstand. Then, I'll program the display with React and use chromuium in kiosk mode to render it.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
